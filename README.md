How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?


  The best way to create programs that have these qualities are to make them orderly, transferable and modular. The advantage of making modular programs such as the CRUD Python file is that it can be used easily with other     programs and applications. You can use this module for just about anything that stores documents! Car dealerships, libraries, video games, etc. This CRUD module seems highly interchangable.

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

    The further along I get in this course, the better I get at breaking down big problems into smaller, more manageable ones. Also, doing it all step-by-step in a logical, methodical way produces less mayhem and a better       product overall. I think that the most frustrating thing about this database experience was that nothing ever seemed to work. In the future, I would certainly like to learn more about databases, because it seemed like even the simple things were very detail-oriented, and easily messed-up. 

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

    Computer scientist are problem solvers. Grazioso Salvare wanted a product with certain specifications, and We did what we could to meet their expectations. It would certainly help save time, and having some technical expertise doesn't hurt, either.
